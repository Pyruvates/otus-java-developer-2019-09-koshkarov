ATM Emulator

Write an ATM emulator.

An ATM class object must be able to:

- accept banknotes of different denominations (there must be a separate cell for each denomination);

- issue the requested amount in a minimum number of banknotes or an error if the amount cannot be issued;

This is not a task for algorithms, but for design, so there is no need to optimize the issuance.

- issue the amount of the remaining funds.
